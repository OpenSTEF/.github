# Project Governance

The basic principle is that decisions are based on consensus. If this decision making process takes too long or a decision is required, the Technical Steering committee has the authority to make a decision.

## Technical Steering Committee

The Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for:

1. General ambitions, objectives and goals of this project
2. Guidelines and procedures and tool selection
3. Architectural and (development) infrastructure choices
4. Raise subjects/issues that are important for the direction/development of this project

The TSC consists of the following members:
1. Jonas van den Bogaard
2. Frank Kreuwel
3. Jan Maarten van Doorn
4. Frederik Stoel
5. Daan van Es (chair)
6. Maxime Fortin
7. Bart Pleiter
 
Any community member or Contributor can ask that something be reviewed by the TSC by contacting the TSC at korte.termijn.prognoses@alliander.com.

## Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for maintaining parts of the code-base. Maintainers have the following responsibilities

1. Coordinate development activity
2. Make sure code/documentation reviews are being done
3. Coordinate pull-requests
4. Coordinate bug follow-ups
5. Coordinate questions
6. In case of long discussions or arguments, maintainers or other can request a community council decision.

The current maintainers of this project are:
1. Daan van Es
2. Jan Maarten van Doorn
3. Frederik Stoel
4. Bart Pleiter
5. Clara de Smet
6. Egor Dmitriev
7. Lars Schilders

Any community member or Contributor can ask a question or raise a issue to the maintainers by logging a GitHub issue.

## Contributors

Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the project.

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.
